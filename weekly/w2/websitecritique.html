	<h2>The Good</h2>
	<h3><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com">Shader Toy</a></h3>
	<p>
		Shader toy in my opinion is a fantastic website as it very quickly tells you what it’s about and makes navigation very easy.  Being a website about showcasing shaders, it makes life easy by having sporting animated thumbnails for browsing content.  Furthermore, you can search based on certain tags when browsing quite easily.  When viewing a specific shader, it offers many different options to display the content and even display’s source code and textures next to it fostering a community, open source environment.

	<h3><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/dynamic-volumetric-cloud-rendering-for-games-on-multi-core-platforms/">Intel</a></h3>
	<p>
		Intel has a very good website as far as how it presents information.  It has articles regarding its various products and systems, but also has a few research journals which caught my attention.  The few that I read were detailing methodology for working with procedural content and I was impressed that the site switched to a more streamlined presentation for this content.  No UI clutter or extra buttons, just well organized information and graphics.

	<h2>The Bad</h2>
	<h3><a href="http://www.gatesnfences.com/Aluminum_Driveway_Gates_3.html">Gates n Fences</a></h3>
	<p>
		While I had to search to find this, I do not believe I have ever been so overwhelmed with information.  This site has way too many words on its homepage, it just looks taxing to read and not worth the time.  As a programmer I’ve read through many long complicated scripts and functions, but this is just dysfunctional.  It almost seems that one would have to intentionally create something this bad, or perhaps the company couldn’t afford any more branching pages?  There is even a visa card that floats across the screen saying “buy now”.
