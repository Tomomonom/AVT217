						The aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in
						the field of human-computer interaction in 1995.  Reasearchers
						 Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura from the Hitachi Design Center
						 tested 26 variations of an ATM UI, asking the 252 study participants to rate
						 each design on ease of use, as well as aesthetic appeal.  They found a stronger
						 correlation between the participants' ratings of aesthetic appeal and perceived 
						 ease of use than the correlation between the ratings of aesthetic appeal and 
						 actual ease of use.  Kurosu and Kashimura concluded that users are strongly influenced 
						 by the aesthetics of any given interface, even when they try to evaluate teh underlying functionality 
						 of the system.
