		<h1><a href="https://www.tenghaowang.com">Ryan Wang - Technical Artist</a></h1>
		<p>The site itself is quite dated in appearance, but at the same time, the content and showcase of works 
		makes up for it.  It's well organized and populated with impressive videos of tools that have immediate use 
		to those who may wish to hire him so I consider this a job well done!</p>
		<br>
		<h1><a href="https://www.natbird.com/index.html">Nat Bird - Technical Artist</a></h1>
		<p>I like that this portfolio also acts as a resume in some ways, noting her experience teaching as well.
		 It has a very modern design and is presented in a very accessible way.</p>
		<br>
		<h1><a href="https://www.martinpalko.com">Martin Palko - Technical Artist</a></h1>
		<p>I personally love this portfolio.  While I believe that most people will not have such big name 
		titles under their belts, the design is quite impressive.  it feels very accessible and scales well to different 
		display sizes.  10/10</p>
		<br>
		<h1><a href="https://www.oztalay.com">Matt Oztalay - Technical Artist</a></h1>
		<p>This portfolio is overall very nice.  It's definitly tech oriented and perhaps lacks a bit of visual appeal,
		 however it is still very good at organizing and showcasing it's works, the most important part.  It's very robust and offers 
		 many different works to show.</p>
		<br>
		<h1><a href="https://www.wolfvanveen.art">Wolf van Veen - Shader and VFX Technical Artist</a></h1>
		<p>Very cool and stylized portfolio. A wide array of works are visible from the homepage and organized well.
		It feels incredibly dynamic and is visually appealing.  However, some of the content seems to break the page.</p>
