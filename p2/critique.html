		<h1>Mangione's on Main</h1>
		<img src="img/mangione.jpg">
		<p>Mangione's website is very clean and features rotating images to showcase the wide
		array of dining options.  I don't have any complaints about this site aside from the oddly sized map at
		the bottom of the page to help you locate the store.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Manhattan Pizza</h1>
		<img src="img/manhattan.jpg">
		<p>Manhattan overall has a very nice site as well.  However, the rotating yelp reviews are not helping the page's design.
		I think it looks quite tacky and is a bit into itself in the wrong ways.  Reviews from customers that are not live can
		definitely feel more curated than anything else.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Pappadeaux</h1>
		<img src="img/pappa.jpg">
		<p>This website is definitely a bit strange, but in a way that I would call stylized.  It doesn't falll into
		the same design pattern that the other websites have been in so far as it doesn't have a clean and small navigation
		with a giant picture of food.  It has a giant picture of food with <em>deals</em> and surely that is a bit different.
		The style of the page also owns the seafood look which is very effective in my opinion.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Magnolia</h1>
		<img src="img/magnolia.jpg">
		<p>The home page of this website fills the entire screen with a picture of the serving counter which does give
		a great example of what kind of decor to expect their.  It establishes it's style very quickly.  My issue here is that
		there seems to be some misleading navigation towards the bottom of the page, pointing you to non existing content.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Kung Fu Tea</h1>
		<img src="img/kungfu.jpg">
		<p>I like this page design, but I do believe it could off putting for many due to the large number of things that appear on screen.
		Deals and offers are nice, but they could stand to be a bit more organized.  That said, the other sub pages are a real treat to navigate.
		They even offer a drink finder on the page that looks and works great on mobile as well.</p>
